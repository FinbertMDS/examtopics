## Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 19 discussion

You have a Linux EC2 web server instance running inside a VPC The instance is In a public subnet and has an EIP associated with it so you can connect to It over the Internet via HTTP or SSH The instance was also fully accessible when you last logged in via SSH. and was also serving web requests on port 80.
Now you are not able to SSH into the host nor does it respond to web requests on port 80 that were working fine last time you checked You have double-checked that all networking configuration parameters (security groups route tables. IGW'EIP. NACLs etc) are properly configured {and you haven't made any changes to those anyway since you were last able to reach the Instance). You look at the EC2 console and notice that system status check shows "impaired."
Which should be your next step in troubleshooting and attempting to get the instance back to a healthy state so that you can log in again?

**A:** Stop and start the instance so that it will be able to be redeployed on a healthy host system that most likely will fix the "impaired" system status

**B:** Reboot your instance so that the operating system will have a chance to boot in a clean healthy state that most likely will fix the 'impaired" system status

**C:** Add another dynamic private IP address to me instance and try to connect via mat new path, since the networking stack of the OS may be locked up causing the ג€impairedג€ system status.

**D:** Add another Elastic Network Interface to the instance and try to connect via that new path since the networking stack of the OS may be locked up causing the "impaired" system status

**E:** un-map and then re-map the EIP to the instance, since the IGWVNAT gateway may not be working properly, causing the "impaired" system status

## Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 21 discussion

Your entire AWS infrastructure lives inside of one Amazon VPC. You have an Infrastructure monitoring application running on an Amazon instance in Availability
Zone (AZ) A of the region, and another application instance running in AZ B. The monitoring application needs to make use of ICMP ping to confirm network reachability of the instance hosting the application.
Can you configure the security groups for these instances to only allow the ICMP ping to pass from the monitoring instance to the application instance and nothing else? If so how?

**A:** No, two instances in two different AZ's can't talk directly to each other via ICMP ping as that protocol is not allowed across subnet (iebroadcast) boundaries

**B:** Yes, both the monitoring instance and the application instance have to be a part of the same security group, and that security group needs to allow inbound ICMP

**C:** Yes, the security group for the monitoring instance needs to allow outbound ICMP and the application instance's security group needs to allow Inbound ICMP

**D:** Yes, both the monitoring instance's security group and the application instance's security group need to allow both inbound and outbound ICMP ping packets since ICMP is not a connection-oriented protocol

## Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 769 discussion

A company is using AWS Storage Gateway to create block storage volumes and mount them as Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) devices from on-premises servers. As the Storage Gateway has taken on several new projects, some of the Development teams report that the performance of the iSCSI drives has degraded. When checking the Amazon CloudWatch metrics, a SysOps Administrator notices that the CacheHitPercent metric is below 60% and the
CachePercentUsed metric is above 90%.
What steps should the Administrator take to increase Storage Gateway performance?

**A:** Change the default block size for the Storage Gateway from 64 KB to 128 KB, 256 KB, or 512 KB to improve I/O performance.

**B:** Create a larger disk for the cached volume. In the AWS Management Console, edit the local disks, then select the new disk as the cached volume.

**C:** Ensure that the physical disks for the Storage Gateway are in a RAID 1 configuration to allow higher throughput.

**D:** Take point-in-time snapshots of all the volumes in Storage Gateway, flush the cache completely, then restore the volumes from the clean snapshots.

SMS of a possible application health problem. However, you also need to watch the watcher -the monitoring instance itself - and be notified if it becomes unhealthy.
Which of the following is a simple way to achieve that goal?

**A:** Run another monitoring instance that pings the monitoring instance and fires a could watch alarm mat notifies your operations team should the primary monitoring instance become unhealthy.

**B:** Set a CloudWatch alarm based on EC2 system and instance status checks and have the alarm notify your operations team of any detected problem with the monitoring instance.

**C:** Set a CloudWatch alarm based on the CPU utilization of the monitoring instance and have the alarm notify your operations team if C r the CPU usage exceeds 50% few more than one minute: then have your monitoring application go into a CPU-bound loop should it Detect any application problems.

**D:** Have the monitoring instances post messages to an SOS queue and then dequeue those messages on another instance should the queue cease to have new messages, the second instance should first terminate the original monitoring instance start another backup monitoring instance and assume (he role of the previous monitoring instance and beginning adding messages to the SQSqueue.

An organization has launched 5 instances: 2 for production and 3 for testing. The organization wants a particular group of IAM users to access only the test instances and not the production ones. They want to deploy the instances in various locations based on the factors that will change from time to time, especially in the test group. They expect instances will often need to be churned, i.e. deleted and replaced, especially in the testing group. This means the five instances they have created now will soon be replaced by a different set of five instances. The members of each group, produc-tion and testing, will not change in the foreseeable future. Given the situation, what choice below is the most efficient and time-saving strategy to define the IAM policy?

**A:** By creating an IAM policy with a condition that allows access to only small instances

**B:** By defining the IAM policy that allows access based on the instance ID

**C:** By launching the test and production instances in separate regions and allowing region wise ac-cess to the group

**D:** By defining the tags on the test and production team members IAM user IDs, and adding a con-dition to the IAM policy that allows access to specific tags

Your mission is to create a lights-out datacenter environment, and you plan to use AWS OpsWorks to accomplish this. First you created a stack and added an App
Server layer with an instance running in it. Next you added an application to the instance, and now you need to deploy a MySQL RDS database instance.
Which of the following answers accurately describe how to add a backend database server to an OpsWorks stack? (Choose three.)

**A:** Add a new database layer and then add recipes to the deploy actions of the database and App Server layers.

**B:** Use OpsWorks' "Clone Stack" feature to create a second RDS stack in another Availability Zone for redundancy in the event of a failure in the Primary AZ. To switch to the secondary RDS instance, set the [:database] attributes to values that are appropriate for your server which you can do by using custom JSON.

**C:** The variables that characterize the RDS database connectionג€"host, user, and so onג€"are set using the corresponding values from the deploy JSON's [:depioy][:app_name][:database] attributes.

**D:** Cookbook attributes are stored in a repository, so OpsWorks requires that the "password": "your_password" attribute for the RDS instance must be encrypted using at least a 256-bit key.

**E:** Set up the connection between the app server and the RDS layer by using a custom recipe. The recipe configures the app server as required, typically by creating a configuration file. The recipe gets the connection data such as the host and database name from a set of attributes in the stack configuration and deployment JSON that AWS OpsWorks installs on every instance.
