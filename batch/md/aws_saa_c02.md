[All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]

The customers of a finance company request appointments with financial advisors by sending text messages. A web application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances accepts the appointment requests. The text messages are published to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue through the web application. Another application that runs on EC2 instances then sends meeting invitations and meeting confirmation email messages to the customers. After successful scheduling, this application stores the meeting information in an Amazon DynamoDB database.<br/>As the company expands, customers report that their meeting invitations are taking longer to arrive.<br/>What should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue?<br/>

A. Add a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in front of the DynamoDB database.

B. Add an Amazon API Gateway API in front of the web application that accepts the appointment requests.

C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the origin as the web application that accepts the appointment requests.

D. Add an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends meeting invitations. Configure the Auto Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue.

[All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notifications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email.<br/>Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the<br/>Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages.<br/>What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?<br/>

A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.

B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.

C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.

D. Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the message is read before processing.

[All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]

A company is developing a new machine learning (ML) model solution on AWS. The models are developed as independent microservices that fetch approximately<br/>1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests and specify where the results should be sent.<br/>The company provides models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models could be unused for days or weeks. Other models could receive batches of thousands of requests at a time.<br/>Which design should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?<br/>

A. Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by the NLB.

B. Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use AWS App Mesh to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size.

C. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by SQS events. Use AWS Auto Scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the SQS queue size.

D. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Enable AWS Auto Scaling on Amazon ECS for both the cluster and copies of the service based on the queue size.

[All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]

A company has a website deployed on AWS. The database backend is hosted on Amazon RDS for MySQL with a primary instance and five read replicas to support scaling needs. The read replicas should lag no more than 1 second behind the primary instance to support the user experience.<br/>As traffic on the website continues to increase, the replicas are falling further behind during periods of peak load, resulting in complaints from users when searches yield inconsistent results. A solutions architect needs to reduce the replication lag as much as possible, with minimal changes to the application code or operational requirements.<br/>Which solution meets these requirements?<br/>

A. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL. Replace the MySQL read replicas with Aurora Replicas and enable Aurora Auto Scaling

B. Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster in front of the database. Modify the website to check the cache before querying the database read endpoints.

C. Migrate the database from Amazon RDS to MySQL running on Amazon EC2 compute instances. Choose very large compute optimized instances for all replica nodes.

D. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB. Initially provision a large number of read capacity units (RCUs) to support the required throughput with on- demand capacity scaling enabled.

An ecommerce company has an order-processing application that uses Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function. The application stores data in an<br/>Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred. Some customers experienced timeouts, and the application did not process the orders of those customers.<br/>A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the database because of a large number of open connections. The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application.<br/>Which solution will meet these requirements?<br/>

A. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions.

B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database. Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint.

C. Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region. Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route traffic to the read replica.

D. Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Modify the Lambda function to use the DynamoDB table.

The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates.<br/>What should the solutions architect do to enable internet access for the private subnets?<br/>

A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.

B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its AZ.

C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet gateway.

D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress- only internet gateway.
