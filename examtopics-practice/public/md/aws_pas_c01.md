## Exam AWS Certified SAP on AWS - Specialty PAS-C01 topic 1 question 17 discussion

A company is designing a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for an SAP HANA database that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a single Availability Zone. The company can tolerate a long RTO and an RPO greater than zero if it means that the company can save money on its DR process.
The company has configured an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to automatically recover the EC2 instance if the instance experiences an unexpected issue. The company has set up AWS Backint Agent for SAP HANA to save the backups into Amazon S3.
What is the MOST cost-effective DR option for the company's SAP HANA database?

**A:** Set up AWS CloudFormation to automatically launch a new EC2 instance for the SAP HANA database in a second Availability Zone from backups that are stored in Amazon S3. When the SAP HANA database is operational, perform a database restore by using the standard SAP HANA restore process.

**B:** Launch a secondary EC2 instance for the SAP HANA database on a less powerful EC2 instance type in a second Availability Zone. Configure SAP HANA system replication with the preload option turned off.

**C:** Launch a secondary EC2 instance for the SAP HANA database on an equivalent EC2 instance type in a second Availability Zone. Configure SAP HANA system replication with the preload option turned on.

**D:** Set up AWS CloudFormation to automatically launch a new EC2 instance for the SAP HANA database in a second Availability Zone from backups that are stored in Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). When the SAP HANA database is operational, perform a database restore by using the standard SAP HANA restore process.



**Answer: A**

## Exam AWS Certified SAP on AWS - Specialty PAS-C01 topic 1 question 2 discussion

A global retail company is running its SAP landscape on AWS. Recently, the company made changes to its SAP Web Dispatcher architecture. The company added an additional SAP Web Dispatcher for high availability with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to balance the load between the two SAP Web Dispatchers.
When users try to access SAP through the ALB, the system is reachable. However, the SAP backend system is showing an error message. An investigation reveals that the issue is related to SAP session handling and distribution of requests. The company confirmed that the system was working as expected with one SAP Web Dispatcher. The company replicated the configuration of that SAP Web Dispatcher to the new SAP Web Dispatcher.
How can the company resolve the error?

**A:** Maintain persistence by using session cookies. Enable session stickiness (session affinity) on the SAP Web Dispatchers by setting the wdisp/HTTP/esid_support parameter to True.

**B:** Maintain persistence by using session cookies. Enable session stickiness (session affinity) on the ALB.

**C:** Turn on host-based routing on the ALB to route traffic between the SAP Web Dispatchers.

**D:** Turn on URL-based routing on the ALB to route traffic to the application based on URL.



**Answer: B**
